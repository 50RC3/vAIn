# vAIn Architecture

## Components

### 1. Frontend (React)
**Technologies**: React, React Router, WebSocket, CSS/SCSS

**Responsibilities**:
- Display real-time updates from the backend (task updates, performance metrics, visualizations).
- Provide a user interface for task management, performance monitoring, and visualizations.
- Handle user interactions (e.g., task updates, filtering performance data).
- Display notifications about system events like task updates or errors.

**Key Components**:
- **App.js**: The main entry point that integrates the various pages and components of the frontend.
- **Dashboard.js**: Displays an overview of the system performance and task status.
- **TaskDetails.js**: Allows users to see detailed information about a specific task.
- **Visualization.js**: Displays AGI performance and task visualization using charts and graphs.
- **Notification.js**: Handles real-time notifications to users.

---

### 2. Backend (FastAPI)
**Technologies**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, WebSockets, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy

**Responsibilities**:
- Serve as the main backend that handles RESTful API requests and WebSocket communication.
- Fetch and send data to the frontend on request (e.g., task data, performance data, visualizations).
- Handle real-time updates using WebSockets for task updates and visualization changes.
- Perform business logic, such as task management and performance tracking.

**Key Modules**:
- **Task API (/tasks)**: Allows users to fetch task data, update tasks, and manage task states.
- **Performance API (/performance)**: Provides system performance metrics for visualization and monitoring.
- **Visualization API (/visualizations)**: Fetches and sends data for generating charts/graphs for system performance.
- **WebSocket Service (/ws/tasks)**: Real-time communication for task updates, sent to the frontend via WebSocket.

---

### 3. WebSocket Service
**Technologies**: WebSocket, FastAPI, asyncio

**Responsibilities**:
- Establish a WebSocket connection to push real-time updates to the frontend (e.g., task status updates, performance changes).
- Communicate asynchronously with the backend to ensure the frontend is kept in sync with the latest AGI-related activities.

**Events**:
- **taskUpdate**: Sent whenever a task's status changes (e.g., completion or failure).
- **visualizationUpdate**: Sent when there is a change in the performance or visualized data.

---

### 4. Database
**Technologies**: PostgreSQL (or NoSQL depending on data needs), SQLAlchemy (ORM)

**Responsibilities**:
- Store AGI task data (task name, status, priority, etc.).
- Store model performance data, including historical performance metrics.
- Store visualization data that is used to render charts and graphs.

**Tables**:
- **tasks**: Stores details about each AGI task.
- **performance**: Stores performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, etc.
- **visualizations**: Stores visualization configurations and data.

---

### 5. Notification System
**Technologies**: WebSocket, React

**Responsibilities**:
- Send real-time notifications about task status changes, performance metrics, or errors.
- Display these notifications in the UI, allowing users to be informed of system updates without needing to refresh the page.

**Event Types**:
- **info**: Informational messages (e.g., task completion).
- **error**: Error messages (e.g., data loading failure).
- **warning**: Warnings about system state (e.g., performance drop).

---

## Data Flow

### User Interaction:
- Users interact with the frontend to manage tasks, view performance, and check visualizations.
- The frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend to fetch or update task data, performance metrics, or visualization information.
- The backend processes the requests and interacts with the database to fetch or store data.

### Real-Time Updates:
- The WebSocket service sends real-time updates for task status changes or visualization updates to the frontend.
- The frontend listens for these updates and automatically updates the UI.
- Notifications are displayed to users regarding task completions, errors, or system alerts.

### Task and Performance Monitoring:
- The backend tracks AGI tasks and monitors system performance.
- The backend sends periodic updates to the frontend about the system's performance and task statuses.
- These updates are used to render graphs and charts on the frontend for real-time monitoring.

---

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing between different pages.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication with the backend.

### Backend:
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for serving FastAPI applications.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database management (PostgreSQL or NoSQL).
- **WebSocket**: For real-time communication between the server and clients.

### Database:
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database to store structured data (tasks, performance metrics, visualizations).

---

## Scalability and Future Enhancements

### Horizontal Scaling:
- As task volume or users increase, horizontal scaling can be implemented on both the frontend and backend.
- WebSocket connections can be load-balanced across multiple servers.

### Database Scaling:
- PostgreSQL can be scaled by using partitioning or sharding for large datasets.
- For high-frequency real-time updates, NoSQL databases like Redis could be considered for caching or storing temporary data.

### Performance Optimization:
- Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve frontend performance, particularly for visualization data.
- Asynchronous processing in FastAPI can help manage high concurrency and improve throughput.
