## Introduction

vAIn is designed for efficient task management, system performance tracking, and data visualization. It includes a RESTful API for managing tasks, real-time performance monitoring, and dynamic visualization updates. You can also receive notifications about important system events or task updates through the WebSocket service.

## Getting Started

To begin using vAIn, ensure you have access to the following:
- A working internet connection.
- API key (if authentication is required).
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates.
  
### Installation
1. **Install the necessary dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have a client to interact with the API (e.g., Postman, Curl, or your application).
   - For WebSocket connections, use any WebSocket client, such as the built-in WebSocket API in modern web browsers.

2. **Set up the WebSocket endpoint**:
   - Connect to the WebSocket service at `ws://localhost/ws/tasks` for task updates and performance data changes.

## Authentication

vAIn supports secure authentication for API access. You can authenticate using API keys or OAuth tokens.

### API Key Authentication
