# Next Steps:
"""
Model Integration: Integrate pre-trained models like BERT or GPT for advanced intent classification, improving the chatbotâ€™s understanding and response accuracy.

Context Expansion: Enhance the context manager to support long-term conversations by maintaining session data or a knowledge base for richer interactions.

User Interaction: Add advanced features like voice recognition, multi-turn conversations, and personalized responses for a more dynamic and engaging user experience.

Advanced Scheduling: Implement complex scheduling logic, including recurring tasks, prioritization, and parallel processing, to handle tasks more efficiently.
